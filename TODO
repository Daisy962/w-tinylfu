- test whether a frequencyfilter suffices or if we also need a doorkeeper mechanism
- perhaps rename get_{lru,mru}_pos to get_{cold,hot}_pos to better reflect the names
- think about whether to employ the policy pattern for the internal caches. though I
  doubt this is necessary (and it needlessly complicates the implementation as I don't
  see a good way to adapt independent caches to work well with the window <-> main
  victim comparison for tinylfu (normally caches don't return the evicted pages or
  grant clients any access to it, but tinylfu needs the main internal cache's victim
  to determine whether to admit the window's victim...)
